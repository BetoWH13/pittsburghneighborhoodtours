Welcome to Bloomfield, or as the locals might say, Benvenuto a Bloomfield! This lively neighborhood, affectionately known as Pittsburgh's Little Italy, is a colorful blend of old-world charm and modern-day vibrancy. From the moment you enter through the grand Liberty Avenue gateway, where bold signs proudly announce your arrival, you'll know you're in a place steeped in rich cultural heritage. Red, white, and green stripes adorn fire hydrants, street curbs, and lamp posts, and the names of long-standing family businesses like Cercone, D'Amico, and Lombardozzi are proudly displayed on storefronts throughout the neighborhood.

But there's more to Bloomfield than its Italian roots—this is a community that welcomes all, offering a diverse array of dining, shopping, and cultural experiences.

### A Rich Historical Tapestry

Bloomfield's story begins long before its streets were filled with the sounds of Italian spoken in the shops and restaurants. The area was once a stretch of rolling farmland, referenced in George Washington's journals as "the high ground through a field of many blooms." It wasn't until the late 1700s that German immigrants began to settle here, laying the foundation for what would become a thriving community.

Throughout the 1800s, the neighborhood grew as more German families arrived, followed by Irish immigrants after the Civil War. You can still see beautiful Victorian homes from this era on streets like Mathilda and Winebiddle, and Atlantic and Pacific Avenues. The Gothic Revival St. Joseph's Church, founded by the Germans in 1886, stands as a testament to the neighborhood's early roots.

The Italian influence that Bloomfield is now famous for began to take shape after World War I. Italian immigrants, primarily from the Abruzzi region, were drawn to the area by job opportunities in the steel mills and railroads. By the 1970s, the neighborhood had become a vibrant Italian enclave, with Liberty Avenue transforming into a bustling hub of Italian culture. The Italian community even established their own place of worship, Immaculate Conception, with a church that still serves as a landmark on Liberty Avenue today.

### A Culinary and Cultural Haven

While Bloomfield's Italian heritage is still very much alive, the neighborhood has grown to embrace a wider variety of cultural influences. Yes, Liberty Avenue is lined with fantastic Italian eateries, markets, and bakeries where you can enjoy everything from fresh pasta to mouth-watering cannoli. But Bloomfield's culinary offerings don't stop there.

For a taste of Poland, the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern is a must-visit. This local favorite, fondly known as the BBT, is a bastion of Polish pride. From the parking lot, adorned with tributes to Polish heroes, to the menu filled with pierogies, haluski, and duck soup, the BBT offers a delicious dive into Polish comfort food.

And then there's Tessaro's, a legendary spot famous for its wood-fired grilled burgers, often hailed as the best in the city. The irresistible aroma wafts down Liberty Avenue, tempting even the most devoted pasta lovers to detour from their usual fare. For more diverse dining options, you'll find Thai Cuisine, Ritter's Diner, and Nico's Recovery Room, where Greek dishes take center stage.

When it's time to unwind, Bloomfield has you covered with a variety of night spots like Lot 17, Mezzanotte Cafe, and Gators, each offering a laid-back atmosphere perfect for enjoying great food and drinks with friends.

And if you're in the mood for something a little different, Bloomfield's arts and culture scene is thriving, too. The neighborhood boasts two coffee shops, several art galleries, and even a record store, all catering to those looking for a cultural fix.
