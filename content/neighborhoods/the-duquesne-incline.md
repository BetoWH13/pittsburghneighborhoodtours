## History of the Duquesne Incline

The Duquesne Incline has been part of Pittsburgh since 1877. Originally built to carry workers up and down the steep hillside of Mount Washington, it was an important part of everyday life for the city's residents. Back then, the steep hills made it hard for people to reach their homes, and the incline was the perfect solution. Today, it remains a symbol of Pittsburgh's history and resilience.

The incline was saved by local residents in the 1960s when it was at risk of closing, and it has been lovingly maintained ever since. Riding the Duquesne Incline feels like traveling back in time, as the original wooden cars and machinery have been preserved to give visitors a true sense of Pittsburgh's past.
