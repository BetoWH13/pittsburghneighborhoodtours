Pittsburgh has a sweet side that's just as rich as its industrial heritage. From legendary cakes to iconic frozen treats, the Steel City has produced some truly unforgettable desserts. Let's take a closer look at some of the most famous desserts that call Pittsburgh home.

## 1. Burnt Almond Torte: A Pittsburgh Legend

The Burnt Almond Torte is perhaps Pittsburgh's most beloved dessert. This layered cake, featuring vanilla custard between layers of white cake, all covered in a generous coating of caramelized almonds, has been a staple at Pittsburgh celebrations for decades.

Originally created by Prantl's Bakery, the Burnt Almond Torte has achieved legendary status in the city. It's the kind of dessert that Pittsburghers who have moved away dream about, and visitors quickly understand why. The combination of the creamy custard, moist cake, and crunchy almonds creates a perfect balance of textures and flavors.

## 2. Klondike Bar: Pittsburgh's Frozen Treat Icon

"What would you do for a Klondike Bar?" This famous tagline belongs to a treat that has its roots right here in Pittsburgh. The Klondike Bar was originally produced by the Isaly Dairy Company, a Pittsburgh-based company that was known for its dairy products and ice cream.

The original Klondike Bar featured a square of vanilla ice cream coated in a thin shell of chocolate. While the brand has since been acquired by larger companies, the Klondike Bar remains a nostalgic reminder of Pittsburgh's contribution to American dessert culture.

## 3. Sarris Candies: A Chocolate Lover's Paradise

Located just outside Pittsburgh in Canonsburg, Sarris Candies has been crafting handmade chocolates since 1960. What started as a small candy shop has grown into one of the most beloved chocolate destinations in the region.

Sarris is famous for its wide variety of chocolates, from classic truffles and caramels to seasonal specialties. Their ice cream parlor is a destination in itself, serving generous sundaes and milkshakes alongside their famous candies. A visit to Sarris Candies is a must for anyone with a sweet tooth visiting the Pittsburgh area.

Pittsburgh's dessert scene is a testament to the city's rich culinary heritage. Whether you're indulging in a slice of Burnt Almond Torte, enjoying a Klondike Bar on a hot summer day, or sampling the handmade chocolates at Sarris Candies, you're experiencing a piece of Pittsburgh's sweet history.
