Pittsburgh's pizza history is rooted in the traditional Italian-American pizzerias that have been serving the community for decades. These establishments, often family-owned, pride themselves on their adherence to time-honored recipes and techniques.

Milo's Pizza is a prime example of a classic Pittsburgh pizzeria. Located in the heart of the city, Milo's has been serving up traditional pies since the 1950s. Their pizza is known for its slightly thicker crust, tangy tomato sauce, and generous cheese topping. Milo's sticks to the basics, offering a no-frills approach that has kept locals coming back for generations.

**Why It's a Must-Try:** Milo's and other traditional pizzerias like it offer a taste of nostalgia with every bite. The simplicity and quality of their ingredients, coupled with a tried-and-true preparation method, ensure that every pizza is as delicious as the last.

## 2. The Rise of Gourmet: Artisan and Wood-Fired Pizzas

As Pittsburgh's food scene has grown and diversified, so too has its pizza offerings. In recent years, there has been a surge in artisan and wood-fired pizzerias, where the focus is on high-quality ingredients, innovative flavors, and artisanal techniques.

Mercurio's in Shadyside is a leader in Pittsburgh's artisan pizza movement. Their wood-fired pizzas feature a thin, crispy crust that's cooked to perfection in a traditional wood-burning oven. Toppings include a mix of classic and gourmet ingredients, such as buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto, arugula, and truffle oil.

**Why It's a Must-Try:** Artisan pizzerias like Mercurio's are redefining what pizza can be. The emphasis on fresh, high-quality ingredients and traditional cooking methods creates a pizza that's not only delicious but also a work of culinary art.

In addition to traditional and artisan pizzas, Pittsburgh has seen an explosion of creativity in its pizza offerings. Many pizzerias are pushing the boundaries of what pizza can be, experimenting with bold flavors, unconventional toppings, and even new shapes and formats.

Spirit in Lawrenceville is known for its experimental approach to pizza. The pizzeria, located in a former funeral home, serves up unique pies that you won't find anywhere else. Their menu includes options like the "Fun Guy," topped with a mix of wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, and bechamel sauce, as well as the "Buffalo Cauliflower," which features roasted cauliflower, buffalo sauce, and blue cheese.
